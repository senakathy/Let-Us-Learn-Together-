Graph Relation Analyzer



This project implements a directed graph using an adjacency list in Python. The graph supports adding edges, retrieving vertices and edges, and checking important relation properties commonly studied in discrete mathematics.



The program can determine whether a graph is:



1. Reflexive
2. Symmetric
3. Antisymmetric
4. Transitive
5. An Equivalence Relation
6. A Partial Order



This class is useful for modeling relations between elements and verifying their mathematical properties in a clean, object-oriented way.
